Casio Digital Diary SF-4300A backup - a retrocomputing project

The source code of this project illustrates how to back up data from a Casio Digital Diary SF-4300A device
via the serial interface. That's at least what I remember it did almost 22 years ago.

You need a couple of vintage things to really run this code:
1. Atari ST computer
2. Turbo C for Atari ST
3. Casio Digital Diary SF-4300A
4. a custom-made serial cable for connecting the Casio Digital Diary SF-4300A to the serial interface of the Atari ST

Well, I must admit that the number of people who might find this useful is rather limited.

Criterion 1. might apply to several thousand people worldwide who still possess an Atari ST machine.
Criterion 2. might be more tricky, because buying a copy of Turbo C might be close to impossible today.
Criterion 3. is no big deal, because you can still buy Casio Digital Diary devices on ebay if you are willing to spend up to 20 $.
Criterion 4. is a big harder, because you have to figure out how to solder the cable.

So good luck, and please don't even try to ask me for help with this project.
